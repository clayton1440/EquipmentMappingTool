# Equipment Mapping Tool

Equipment Mapping Tool is an application designed to eliminate the need to manually search a large area for a physical piece of equipment. It allows users to create a custom map of the overall area and place items in a precise (1' x 1') location within. Locations on the map which contain items are designated with a count of the items. If any item in a location is expired or nearing expiration, the cell location is highlighted.
